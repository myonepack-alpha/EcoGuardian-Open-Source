# EcoGuardian & AeroCortex: Open Source Ecosystem Stabilization

**Status:** Conceptual Design (v1.0) | **License:** Apache 2.0 (Hardware), CC-BY-4.0 (Framework)

## The Challenge
Earth's ecosystems are experiencing unprecedented stress. Climate change is not a future threat—it's an ongoing process where natural adaptation operates on evolutionary timescales, while climate change operates on human timescales. [cite_start]This mismatch creates an extinction vortex[cite: 10, 11].

[cite_start]**EcoGuardian** is a strategic framework to bridge this gap using autonomous systems as an "ecological prosthetic"[cite: 12].
**AeroCortex X1** is the open-hardware SoC designed to power these systems.

## Strategic Pillars
Our mission is built on four pillars (see `framework/pillars.md` for full details):
1.  [cite_start]**SENSE:** A planetary nervous system for real-time biodiversity monitoring[cite: 36].
2.  [cite_start]**PROTECT:** Active defense against poaching and wildfires[cite: 74].
3.  [cite_start]**RESTORE:** Precision reforestation and coral regeneration at scale[cite: 128].
4.  [cite_start]**BRIDGE:** Assisted migration for species unable to track climate velocity[cite: 202].

## Hardware: AeroCortex X1 SoC
The compute engine behind the mission. See `hardware/architecture.md` for specifications.

* [cite_start]**Architecture:** Dual-Core Cognitive (STL Planning + CML Perception)[cite: 550].
* [cite_start]**Performance:** 48 TOPS (INT8) / 12 TFLOPS (FP16)[cite: 551].
* [cite_start]**Safety:** Lockstep CPU and Fail-Safe FSM for DO-178C compliance[cite: 693].

## Call to Action
The technology exists. The understanding exists. What's needed is the will to deploy at scale.

* **Hardware Engineers:** Help us optimize the [PKC Predictor Engine](hardware/architecture.md#23-pkc-predictor-engine-predictive-kinematics-chain).
* **Ecologists:** Validate our [Species Intervention Score](CONTRIBUTING.md).
* **Developers:** Build on our [C++ SDK](hardware/api/).
